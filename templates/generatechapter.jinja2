The unforgiving sun blazed overhead, its relentless heat searing Aleximandra’s skin as she squinted against the glare. Sweat streaked down her face, stinging her eyes, but she barely noticed. The landscape stretched endlessly before her—an ocean of sand and brittle shrubs, offering no landmarks, no sense of how far they had come or how much farther they had to go.

Adjusting the straps of her heavy pack, she swallowed against the dryness in her throat. Their supplies were dwindling—water, most of all. The thought of another hour under this merciless sun without hydration sent a pang of dread through her chest. Her tongue felt thick, her lips cracked as she rasped, “We need to find shelter.”

Beside her, Jakereshimushka scanned the horizon with narrowed eyes, his posture rigid with determination. The tattered remains of his green uniform, worn thin from months of travel and battle, clung loosely to his lean frame. He looked just as drained, just as desperate.

They pressed on, trudging toward a distant ridge, every step an effort against the shifting sands. Aleximandra’s thoughts churned. They couldn’t afford mistakes—not in a place where a single misstep meant death. And now, as dark figures loomed at the crest of the ridge, it seemed their path had led them straight into the hands of another group—nomads, wild and untamed.

Her pulse quickened as they neared the gathering. Tension crackled in the air. She saw Jakereshimushka’s muscles coil, his hand drifting instinctively toward the hilt of his knife. They were outnumbered, but retreat wasn’t an option.

Then Kael stepped forward.

His words sent a thrill of both excitement and unease through Aleximandra. He wanted them to scout the rival clan—an offer laced with danger, but also with opportunity. In this brutal world, alliances were more precious than gold, and proving themselves could mean survival.

She turned to Jakereshimushka, meeting his gaze. The same determination burned in his eyes, a reflection of her own resolve. They had come too far, endured too much. There was no turning back now.

Aleximandra faced Kael, her decision made, her voice steady.

“We’re in.”
