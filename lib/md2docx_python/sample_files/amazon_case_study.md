**Question: Did it make sense for a technology company like amazon with stratospheric stock price to enter gross market industry with thin margin industry?**

Yes, it can make sense for a technology company like Amazon with a high stock price to enter a thin-margin industry. Here’s why:

1. **Economies of Scale**: Amazon has significant resources and scale, allowing it to achieve economies of scale that can help mitigate the impact of thin margins. The company's extensive logistics and distribution network can reduce costs and improve efficiency.

2. **Diversification**: Entering different industries helps Amazon diversify its revenue streams and reduce dependency on any single sector. This can be a strategic move to hedge against market fluctuations and capture new growth opportunities.

3. **Market Penetration**: Amazon’s entry into a thin-margin industry might be aimed at dominating or disrupting that market. Even with thin margins, a large market share can translate into significant overall revenue and profitability due to volume.

4. **Long-Term Strategy**: Amazon often invests in lower-margin or loss-leading areas with the expectation that these ventures will become profitable in the long run or provide strategic advantages such as increased customer data, market share, or complementary services.

5. **Customer Acquisition**: A thin-margin industry might be a way for Amazon to attract more customers and drive traffic to its broader ecosystem, including its higher-margin services like AWS or Prime memberships.

In summary, while thin margins present challenges, Amazon's large scale, strategic focus, and long-term vision can make it feasible for them to enter and succeed in such industries.
